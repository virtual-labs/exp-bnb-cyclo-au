### About the Experiment 

The Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for Cyclopeptide Sequencing is a computational approach used to determine the amino acid sequence of cyclic peptides from mass spectrometry data. This algorithm systematically explores possible peptide sequences while eliminating unlikely candidates based on mass constraints, significantly reducing computational complexity. By efficiently pruning the search space, it ensures accurate and rapid identification of cyclic peptides, which are important in drug discovery and biological research.
